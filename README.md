# shift-viewer
A calendar of polish correctional officers shifts. Supports 4-shift and 2-shift system. Shows duty-days, duty-nights, days off and public holidays in Poland. Based on polish Labor Code (Kodeks Pracy). 
Designed for Security Department officers.
This is the app version with declared shifts for my friends. More universal version for all penitentiary units will be added soon.
